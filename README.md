# decorder-ring-project from Thinkful

## By Andrew Furrer

A project to encode and decode messages from user inputted messages from a varierty of encoding methods, and using the same methods to decode messages

With a heavy focus on Test Driven Development

## Caesar ()

Takes the value of a letter (EX: A = 0, B = 1...etc) and adds a user inputted number along side to transform each letter in a messages

While the decoding for it takes it in the opposite direction to decode messages

## Polybius ()

Using a custom polybius square translate individual letters in a message to numbers based on the polybius value (EX: A = 11, F = 12...etc)

Decoding taking the process and checking values and cross referencing with the polybius square to turn two digit numbers into letters

## Substituion ()

![Substitution cipher example] (https://i.gyazo.com/bfe443cb0181f07c8564c0833ae99169.png)

With a user inputted message, and a user inputted Substituion alphabet swapping letters based on the index real alphabet and using that info into the user inputted alphabet

Decoding working in reverse, taking the index of letters in user inputted alphabet, and using its index in the actual alphabet
